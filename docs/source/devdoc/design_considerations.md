# Design Considerations

## Error Propagations
The debugging of errors in the data repository is difficult, since the respective scripts are called via `subprocess`. The resulting challenge is to create a pipeline for both usefull debug messages and outputs in the nominal case. The following graphic depicts how error messages that arise during the execution of the execscript are propagated:

Which information is show in the different cases of settings, error type and execution methode is shown the following table:

|----------------------|------------------------------------|-----------------------------------|-----------------|
|                      | **settings.DEBUG == True**         | **settings.DEBUG == False**       |                 |
| **nominal**          | show output, result: "success"     | show output, result: "success"    | log, "success"    |
| **numnerical error** | show output, result: "inaccurate"   | show output, result: "inaccurate" | log, "inaccurate" |
| **script error**     | show debug, result: "script error" | actively delete output, result: "script error"      | log, "fail"       |
